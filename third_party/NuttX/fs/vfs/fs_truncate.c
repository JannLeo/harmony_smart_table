/****************************************************************************
 * Name: ftruncate
 *
 * Description:
 *   The ftruncate() function causes the regular file referenced by fd to
 *   have a size of length bytes.
 *
 *   If the file previously was larger than length, the extra data is
 *   discarded.  If it was previously shorter than length, it is unspecified
 *   whether the file is changed or its size increased.  If the file is
 *   extended, the extended area appears as if it were zero-filled.  If fd
 *   references a shared memory object, ftruncate() sets the size of the
 *   shared memory object to length. If the file is not a regular file or
 *   a shared memory object, the result is unspecified.

 *   With ftruncate(), the file must be open for writing; for truncate(),
 *   the process must have write permission for the file.
 *
 *   ftruncate() does not modify the file offset for any open file
 *   descriptions associated with the file.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fd     - A reference to an open, regular file or shared memory object
 *            to be truncated.
 *   length - The new length of the file or shared memory object.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 * On success, 0.
 * On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appro-priately:
 *
 *
